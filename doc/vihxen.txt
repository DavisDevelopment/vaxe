INTRODUCTION                                    *vihxen*
                                                *vihxen-introduction*

This plugin adds support for Haxe syntax, indenting, and compiling.  Also
included is syntax and support for Hxml.

Vihxen uses the Haxe compiler extensively to determine code completions, 
and generate various metadata.  The compiler, in turn, uses sequences of 
compiler directives in "hxml" files in order to specify build and output 
options, similar to gnu makefiles.

Vihxen has two different "build modes" that designate how to find the hxml
file, as well as how to manage the output.

BUILD MODES                                     *vihxen-build*

Default                                         *vihxen-default-mode* 
                        This mode is used automatically any time a *.hx file 
                        is opened.  It can be retriggered by calling 
                        vihxen#DefaultHxml. Vihxen will search the project 
                        path for the preferred file indicated by 
                        |g:vihxen_prefer_hxml|.
                        If it finds a preferred build file in the parent
                        directories of the currently edited file, it will set
                        a b:vihxen_hxml variable for the current buffer.
                        It will cd to the preferred hxml directory, call the 
                        compiler with the preferred hxml, and redirect errors 
                        to standard out.

Project                                         *vihxen-project-mode* 
                        This mode is used when |vihxen#ProjectHxml| is called.
                        It will set a g:vihxen_hxml variable that will 
                        override any b:vihxen_hxml variables set by the default
                        method.  It will simply execute the haxe compiler 
                        without changing directories, and redirect errors to
                        standard out.

COMMANDS                                        *vihxen-commands*

:vihxen#CompilerClassPaths
                        Retrieve the class paths for the current build target

:vihxen#Ctags           Generate a ctags file for the current build target

:vihxen#CurrentBuild    Retrieve the directives for the current build

:vihxen#DefaultHxml     Find the preferred build file recursively in the
                        parents of the working directory

:vihxen#HaxeComplete    The omnifunc for vihxen

:vihxen#OpenHxml        Open the current build file specified with
                        vihxen#DefaultHxml, or vihxen#ProjectHxml

:vihxen#ProjectHxml     Find and select hxml files in the working directory.
                        Selecting a file with this method will enter
                        |vihxen-project-mode|.


SETTINGS                                        *vihxen-settings*
